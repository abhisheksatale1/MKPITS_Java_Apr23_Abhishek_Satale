<h1> CAR </h1> <br> <br> 
<h3> What is very important in cars? </h3> <br> Seat belts are the most basic and essential safety feature in a car. They keep you safe by keeping you secured to your seat. Seat belts prevent you from being thrown around the car in the event of an accident, keeping you safe.
<h3> Why is it called car? </h3> <br> The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot". It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.
<h3> What is the use of cars? </h3> <br> An automobile is a self-propelled motor vehicle intended for passenger transportation on land. It usually has four wheels and an internal combustion engine fueled most often by gasoline, a liquid petroleum product.
